Cat vs. dog image classification is a computer vision task that involves classifying images as either containing a dog or a cat. This task is typically solved using
deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs are a type of neural network that are specifically designed for image processing. They are able to learn the 
features of objects in images, such as the shape, texture, and color of a cat or dog. The first step in cat vs. dog image classification is to collect a dataset of
images. This dataset should be balanced, meaning that it should contain an equal number of images of cats and dogs. The images should also be of high quality and 
well-labeled. Once the dataset has been collected, it can be used to train a CNN. The CNN is trained by feeding it images from the dataset and telling it whether 
each image is of a cat or a dog. The CNN learns to identify the features of cats and dogs by looking at thousands of images. After the CNN has been trained, it can
be used to classify new images. To do this, the CNN is simply fed the new images and it will output a prediction of whether each image is of a cat or a dog.The 
accuracy of cat vs. dog image classification models has improved significantly in recent years. In the early days, models could only achieve accuracies of around 70%.
However, today, state-of-the-art models can achieve accuracies of over 99%. Cat vs. dog image classification is a challenging task, but it is also a very important
one. This task has many applications, such as spam filtering, face recognition, and medical image analysis. As deep learning technology continues to improve, we can 
expect to see even more accurate and efficient cat vs. dog image classification models in the future.
